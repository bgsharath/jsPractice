port no. -> run a multiple services in a single machine and communicate all of them differently

HTTP runs on port 80 (or 8080), HTTPS on port 443 (or 8443). SSH runs on port 22. DNS runs on port 53, and so on.
You have a finite number of ports, and the range of ports is from 0 to 65535. This means you cannot start a process on port number 70000 (as it is outside the valid port range)
